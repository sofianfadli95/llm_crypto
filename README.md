Investing in cryptocurrency has recently become very popular, especially among young people. Many people are tempted to put their money into this instrumentation, in the hope of making big money in a short time.

But this instrumentation is not easy. Due to the rapid release of new products, changes in the narrative trend of cryptocurrencies, very fast price fluctuations, and so on, many beginners often end up experiencing losses rather than profits.

Therefore, I am interested in creating this project with the hope that in the future this project can help many beginners to learn and invest in the right crypto instrumentation assets.

This project was implemented for 
[LLM Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp) -
a free course about LLMs and RAG.
