"A blockchain is a distributed, cryptographically-secure database structure that allows network participants to establish a trusted and immutable record of transactional data without the need for intermediaries. It can execute various functions beyond transaction settlement, such as smart contracts—digital agreements embedded in code that can have limitless formats and conditions. Blockchains are capable of securely coordinating data, as well as enabling tokenization, incentive design, attack-resistance, and reducing counterparty risk. The first blockchain was the Bitcoin blockchain, resulting from over a century of advancements in cryptography and database technology.","A blockchain is a distributed, cryptographically-secure database structure that allows network participants to establish a trusted and immutable record of transactional data without the need for intermediaries.

"A blockchain is different from traditional databases primarily in its decentralized architecture and the way it handles data security and validation. In traditional databases, there is a centralized client-server model where a sole authority controls the server, which creates a single point of failure for data security and management. In contrast, a blockchain consists of many distributed nodes that collaborate to reach consensus and maintain a shared, immutable record of transactions. This decentralized approach enhances security and reduces the risks associated with data alteration and deletion. Additionally, blockchains enable trusted and cryptographically secure transactions without the need for intermediaries, making them capable of executing various functions beyond simple data storage, such as smart contracts and tokenization.","A blockchain is a distributed, cryptographically-secure database structure that allows network participants to establish a trusted and immutable record of transactional data without the need for intermediaries.

"Ethereum handles transaction verification through a network of voluntarily operated nodes. These nodes contain either the entire or a segment of the Ethereum transaction history, along with the latest information on smart contracts and account balances. Transactions are verified by participants known as miners, who use a Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm to settle transactions. They solve cryptographic puzzles to validate blocks of transactions, with the first miner to complete this process receiving a reward. Additionally, there are plans to transition Ethereum to a Proof of Stake (PoS) system, which will change how transaction verification is conducted.","Like the Bitcoin blockchain, Ethereum utilizes nodes that are operated voluntarily in order to verify transactions in the network.

"Gas limits in Ethereum protect users and miners by ensuring that the maximum payment set for a transaction is adequate to complete it. If a gas limit is set too low, the transaction may fail, and the miner who processes it will keep the gas fees for the work done, even though the transaction did not succeed. This mechanism helps safeguard users from potential losses due to faulty code or attacks on the network. It also protects miners by ensuring they are compensated for their efforts, regardless of whether the transaction ultimately succeeds or fails. Overall, gas limits contribute to the dynamic nature of the Ethereum blockchain, accommodating varying operational demands of different transactions and smart contracts.","The Ethereum gas limit is one of three core concepts of ether. The others are cost and price. Limits are set as the maximum payment one is willing to incur to complete a transaction. If a gas limit is set too low, it is possible that the transaction will fail. This is because the miner who attempts the transaction will go on and execute operations until the gas limit is reached. If additional operations are required, then the miner keeps the gas as fees for work done and the system records the transaction as “failed.” Gas limits are important because they protect both users and miners from faulty codes and network attacks. They are relevant because the dynamic nature of the Ethereum blockchain is comprised of a variety of smart contract operational levels. Not all transactions are the same and therefore require different amounts of gas to fuel their operations.",d1cb650b,How do gas limits protect users and miners in Ethereum?

"Ethereum plans to change its consensus mechanism through a transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) as part of its evolution into Serenity, also known as Ethereum 2.0. This change aims to address scalability and other issues associated with mining, such as excessive energy consumption and centralized mining pools.

"The financial incentive is riskier for malicious actors in Proof of Stake (PoS) because they must stake their own ETH, which means they risk their financial investment in any attack. If an attacker attempts to perform a 51% attack, the cost of failure is significantly higher because they would lose their staked assets. This creates a strong deterrent against malicious behavior, making it a riskier proposition for those considering malicious actions on the network.","On the Ethereum blockchain, miners currently use a Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm to settle transactions.
